Task: Configuring and testing firewall rules to allow and block traffic.
Tools Used: Windows Firewall Defender, Cmd Prompt.
Procedure:
Step:1- Opened Firewall Defender from the search bar and checked for inbound and outbound basic configuration setup.

Step:2- Checked for the basic firewall rules categorization, which includes:
        * Direction: Inbound or Outbound Rules.
        * Name of the Rule, status(Enabled/ Disabled), Action(Allow/ Block).
        * Ports, ipaddress(local or Remote), Protocols.

Step:3- Created a rule with name New Rule in Inbound Rules to check how the Firewall Works.

Step:4- Following steps involved to create a new Rule is mentioned below:
        * Rule Type: Helps to choose the rule which is to be applied either on a Program/ Port/ Predefined/ Custom- Here I choose port.
        * Protocol and Ports: Here we can choose where we are applying it to TCP/ UDP protocol and is it applied to all local ports/ specific port.
        * Action: Allow/ Block connection.
        * Profile: Applies to a Domain/ Private/ Public profile or can choose ALL.
        * Name: User defined Name for the Rule Created.

Step:5- Created Inbound Rule for TCP Port-443 to check if the traffic is blocked from Remote device.

How it Works?
Firewall either Hardware or Software based tool inspect data packets, comparing them to predefined rules to determine whether to allow or block them. 

Observation:
When the rule was enabled, tried to search for the connection through chrome with the help of ipaddress, but I was unable to open the site as it states" THIS SITE CAN"T BE REACHED"

Precautions:
Firewall rules should be designed to allow only the necessary traffic while blocking everything else by default. 
Need to update Firewall Rules, Regular Audits must be dome.
Implement a comprehensive logging and alert mechanism.
